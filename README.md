One widely used method for identifying drug candidates is structure-based drug design (SBDD), which evaluates docking poses and estimates the interaction strength between target proteins and small molecules (ligands). Strong interactions indicate potential drug candidates, as they will affect the physiological function of the target proteins. \\
This project predict accurately binding affinity. This can significantly reduce the cost of developing new drugs.\\
This project use Deep kernel learning and transfer learning from pre-train model protein-ligand-mlp-3 of Jens Glaser\\
